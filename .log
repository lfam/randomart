base64 encodes 3 bytes into 4, splitting the concatenation of the bytes into 4
groups of 6 bits. The 6 bit groups are cast as chars against a custom base64
alphabet. If a triplet is incomplete, pad the spaces with =.

Use isspace on errstring rather than asking strtol_wrapper() to use strtol_err.

Also, don't memset errstring to whitespace when it's allocated. Add the
whitespace in strtol_wrapper() as necessary.

Currently, we process the user's input string two characters at a time, using
strtoul() to convert the character pairs to an unsigned long int. Then, we cast
to an unsigned char before handing over to the movement algorithm. This only
works because we are expecting the input to be hexadecimal. The maximum value of
2 characters of hex is 255, which is also the max value of unsigned char, aka
one byte.

This will need to change if we allow radices besides 16.
