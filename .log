Currently, we process the user's input string two characters at a time, using
strtoul() to convert the character pairs to an unsigned long int. Then, we cast
to an unsigned char before handing over to the movement algorithm. This only
works because we are expecting the input to be hexadecimal. The maximum value of
2 characters of hex is 255, which is also the max value of unsigned char, aka
one byte.

This will need to change if we allow radices besides 16.
